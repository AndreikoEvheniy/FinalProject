#Airline
The airline has a list of flights for which it is necessary to implement:
~~~
 -flight search by number;
 -flight selection by the parameters 'From', 'To', 'Date of departure';
 -sorting flights by number, name.
~~~
The dispatcher:
~~~
Forms a flight team for the flight (pilots, steersman, radio operator, stewardess) 
and manages the status of the flight. In case of problems with the formation of
the team for the flight, the dispatcher can send an application
to the administrator.
~~~
The administrator manages (should be the ability to add, delete, edit):
~~~
-list of flights (can add / delete a flight, edit information about it);
-a list of personnel (can add / delete an employee, edit information about him).
Also, the administrator considers the applications of the dispatcher and closes
them with one of the statuses (completed, deflected).
